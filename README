NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::generate - Generate your dist/dist parts from
    custom global templates.

VERSION
    version 0.01000001

SYNOPSIS
    Similar to Dist::Zilla::App::Command::new , except extensible,
    pluggable, with a system of defaults.

      dzil generate [pragma] @flags
      dzil generate dist -name Foo-Bar ; # -from is instead defaulted

    This is intended to have alternative pragmas, like Module::New, but be
    pluggable, and pluggable on a per-dist basis. ( Allowing you to have
    dist-centric generators ).

EXAMPLE
      dzil generate dist -name Foo-Bar ; # -from is instead defaulted
      dzil generate dist -name Foo-Bar -from mytemplate ;
